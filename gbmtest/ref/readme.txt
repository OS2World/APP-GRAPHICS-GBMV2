This directory contains the reference bitmaps that will
be used for the GBM regression tests.

They will be loaded, saved again, reloaded and then the
header, the palette and the data are compared to the
reference files. These tests are done for file I/O as well
as remapped file I/O to test the I/O setup of GBM as well.

The following test images are included:
